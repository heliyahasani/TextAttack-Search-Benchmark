"When scoping around online for a good NYE [[dinner]] [[destination]] for my husband and me, Casbah's [[prix]] fixe menu [[really]] [[jumped]] off the page! Since the [[Big]] Burrito [[group]] is so [[popular]], I was [[happy]] to [[get]] [[reservations]], [[especially]] since a [[lot]] of times were already [[booked]].\n\nThe hubby and I [[arrived]] a few minutes early for [[dinner]]. I [[had]] [[planned]] [[additional]] time to park and was [[delightfully]] [[reminded]] that [[Big]] Burrito [[restaurants]] [[have]] [[free]] valet parking -- so [[great]], [[especially]] with slushy [[snow]] on the ground! Even [[though]] we were a few minutes [[early]], the hostess [[took]] our coats and [[seated]] us [[immediately]].  \n\nService was [[extremely]] [[attentive]] from [[start]] to [[finish]]. Waters were re-filled [[quickly]]. Bread was brought to the [[table]] almost [[immediately]] and we were [[offered]] another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't [[stop]] eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was [[promptly]] [[replaced]].\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to [[share]] so we could [[try]] the [[entire]] NYE prix fixe [[menu]]. [[None]] of the [[eight]] dishes [[disappointed]]! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was [[perfectly]] [[cooked]], the octopus - [[thought]] not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic [[flavor]] in the [[dish]] was very [[tasty]]. I [[absolutely]] [[loved]] the duck confit [[dish]]. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a [[delicious]] combination!\n\nThe [[second]] courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular!

"[[Despite]] living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow [[managed]] to never [[eat]] at Max's Allegheny Tavern until [[recently]].  \n\nMy [[initial]] impression of the restaurant was [[positive]] - the place had an [[old]] [[neighborhood]] feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the [[end]] of the [[antique]] hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I [[thought]] about how well German [[potato]] salad would [[taste]] with that beer.

Neither one greeted me or [[asked]] me what I would have like to [[order]].  I [[stared]] back, incredulously, and even made a \""""what's going on here\"""" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third [[employee]] came around the bar and [[took]] my order.  Great, I thought to myself, [[finally]] that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who [[serves]] [[imported]] German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the [[result]] of a [[bad]] beer pour and/or a less than [[perfectly]] clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""""Uh-oh\"""".  The menu is huge with a number of \""""slow-food\"""" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""""bacon\"""" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""""meat\"""".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""""The Best in German Fare.

"When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty [[damn]] good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into [[unbeatable]] [[awesome]].\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.","When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty [[cursed]] good job.
