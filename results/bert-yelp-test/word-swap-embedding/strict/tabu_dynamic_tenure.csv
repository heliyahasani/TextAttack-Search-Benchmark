"When scoping around online for a good NYE [[dinner]] [[destination]] for my husband and me, Casbah's [[prix]] fixe menu [[really]] [[jumped]] off the page! Since the [[Big]] Burrito [[group]] is so [[popular]], I was [[happy]] to [[get]] reservations, [[especially]] since a [[lot]] of times were already [[booked]].\n\nThe hubby and I [[arrived]] a few minutes early for [[dinner]]. I [[had]] [[planned]] [[additional]] time to park and was [[delightfully]] [[reminded]] that [[Big]] Burrito [[restaurants]] [[have]] [[free]] valet parking -- so [[great]], [[especially]] with slushy [[snow]] on the ground! Even [[though]] we were a few minutes [[early]], the [[hostess]] [[took]] our coats and [[seated]] us [[immediately]].  \n\nService was [[extremely]] [[attentive]] from [[start]] to [[finish]]. Waters were re-filled [[quickly]]. Bread was brought to the [[table]] almost [[immediately]] and we were [[offered]] another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't [[stop]] eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was [[promptly]] [[replaced]].\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to [[share]] so we could [[try]] the [[entire]] NYE prix fixe [[menu]]. [[None]] of the [[eight]] dishes [[disappointed]]! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was [[perfectly]] [[cooked]], the octopus - [[thought]] not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic [[flavor]] in the [[dish]] was very [[tasty]]. I [[absolutely]] [[loved]] the duck confit [[dish]]. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a [[delicious]] combination!\n\nThe [[second]] courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular!

"[[Despite]] living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow [[managed]] to never [[eat]] at Max's Allegheny Tavern until [[recently]].  \n\nMy [[initial]] impression of the restaurant was [[positive]] - the place had an [[old]] [[neighborhood]] feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the [[end]] of the [[antique]] hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I [[thought]] about how well German [[potato]] salad would [[taste]] with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly [[awaited]] the first [[taste]] of my beer.\n\nAnd I [[waited]]...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before [[someone]] came around to take the [[order]].

Neither one greeted me or [[asked]] me what I would have like to [[order]].  I [[stared]] back, incredulously, and even made a \""""what's going on here\"""" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third [[employee]] came around the bar and [[took]] my order.  Great, I thought to myself, [[finally]] that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who [[serves]] [[imported]] German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the [[result]] of a [[bad]] beer pour and/or a less than [[perfectly]] clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""""Uh-oh\"""".  The menu is huge with a number of \""""slow-food\"""" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""""bacon\"""" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""""meat\"""".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"""".\n\nThat's total bullshit.

"The steaks here are very good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.

"I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was [[strictly]] [[based]] on [[food]], I'd go with 5, [[easily]]. But, it's [[based]] on service, too, which is why I had to [[knock]] one off. Here's the [[deal]]...\n\nI [[love]] Morton's. Its old-school [[interior]] and no-gimmicks shtick is [[awesome]]. [[Plus]], of course, the [[food]] is [[fantastic]]. [[However]], I [[wanted]] to branch out, and Ruth's [[Chris]] had some [[great]] [[reviews]], so I [[utilized]] Yelp's oh-so-convenient [[Open]] [[Table]] [[reservation]] [[feature]], and scored a [[table]] for two on a Saturday [[night]]. \n\nOur [[reservation]] was for 8:30. We [[arrived]] right on the dot, but were [[told]] to go to the bar and [[wait]]. So, my boyfriend and I both [[got]] cocktails -- he [[had]] Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I [[got]] the [[Peachy]] Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we [[waited]]. And [[waited]]. [[Around]] 9, our table was [[ready]]. \n\nOur [[waitress]] was Kristen, and she was [[fantastic]]. Very [[attentive]], [[friendly]], witty, and knowledgeable about the [[food]]. Here's our [[food]] rundown:\n\n- Barbequed [[shrimp]] app: I [[initially]] [[thought]] was BBQ sauce + [[shrimp]], but it ain't. It's succulent li'l [[shrimp]] in a [[deliciously]] garlicky, white wine-infused [[sauce]] with a cayenne [[kick]]. Kristen suggested that we [[dip]] the bread in the [[sauce]] after the shrimp were [[gone]], and we [[happily]] [[took]] her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's [[chopped]] salad: [[Holy]] [[crap]]. The most [[memorable]] salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I [[think]] this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"""" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back.

We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering [[nourishment]] to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.",0.0006254315376281738,0.6390277147293091,1,0,1,1073,"Successful"

I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.","My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore [[sphere]], which was a short car ride away.

The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word....

"THIS is an old-school pizza [[shop]]!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having [[heard]] so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I [[finally]] decided to [[stop]] and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza [[crap]] that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is [[PERFECT]].  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm [[guessing]] that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the [[old]] Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and [[definitely]] not the pepperoni you'll find at [[Papa]] John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your [[youth]] - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, [[complete]] with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my [[neighborhood]], and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the [[vicinity]] of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!","THIS is an old-school pizza [[store]]!

"I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been [[checked]] and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to find a loop in PGH that doesn't!).
