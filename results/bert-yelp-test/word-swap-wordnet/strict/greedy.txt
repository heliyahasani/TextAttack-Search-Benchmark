The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.

Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a [[great]] [[idea]]!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing [[right]] in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I [[felt]] like i was the crazy one. [[I]] asked for a beer/got the beer.\[[n]]\nIn between that time, the other bartender [[brought]] food over and [[set]] it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.

I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""games\"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.

Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.\n\nFriday's is like the \""fine dining chain\"" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...\n\n1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.\n2.  I ordered one of their \""skinny margaritas\"", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.\n3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!\n4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.\n5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.

Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \n\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.

Our last few visits have left something to desire, One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\n\nThe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT, HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning.

Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?

This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very [[overcook]] and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it.

As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and [[feel]]. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.

When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!

My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food.

And [[so]]....the [[search]] for a new hair salon [[continues]]. [[Sigh]]. Don't [[get]] me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what went [[wrong]]. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.

That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was [[still]] a [[deal]].

Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. [[So]] I called. The chick at the counter now said, \""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\"" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \""Oh, [[well]].....I'll refund you $10 if you [[give]] me your credit card number.\"" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? \""[[Sorry]], I don't give my credit card number over the phone.\"" \""Or I can send you a gift certificate.\"" \""Nope,\"" I said through clenched teeth, \""I won't be coming back.\""\n\nIt wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, \""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\"" \n\nThe search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!\n\nP. S.

The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \""get together\"" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!

Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.

Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \[[n]]\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place [[had]] an old neighborhood [[feel]] to it, a small crowd was drinking at the [[end]] of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls [[made]] me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout [[head]] of foam.  I [[thought]] about how [[well]] German potato salad would [[taste]] with that beer.  [[So]] I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first [[taste]] of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and [[waited]]...and waited some more - for over [[15]] minutes before someone came around to take the [[order]].  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one [[greeted]] me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\[[n]]\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and [[took]] my order.  [[Great]], [[I]] [[thought]] to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was [[devoid]] of its [[head]], likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly [[clean]] glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.

Love this place! I was visiting Pittsburgh from Houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum - or should I say museums. Coming from Houston where we have some pretty good museums, this was a pleasant surprise - really cheap considering you get both Art and Natural History.\nThe dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational.  The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs, Monets, Cezannes, etc.\nThe only exhibit I didn't much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about.\nAll in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.

I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.

This was my second visit and alas, my [[last]]. \n\nOur first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed.

BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs, arms, and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 8/10 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back.

I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's, but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really [[good]]. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He [[had]] a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. \nThe beer cave is [[awesome]]. \nI'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.

Being born and [[raised]] into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the [[unknowing]]).

She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later [[adding]] whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil.

I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the [[main]] meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers.

Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to [[be]] on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.  \n\nThe blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti [[cheese]] and cranberry sauce was ridiculously [[good]].  The turkey was juicy and [[melded]] perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative [[considering]] the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and [[pretty]] good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!

The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti [[cheeseflower]] and cranberry sauce was ridiculously [[secure]].  The turkey was juicy and [[combine]] perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative [[reckon]] the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and [[middling]] good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!

DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure.

Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail.

I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \""free\"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""oughts\"" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""busways,\"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""T\"" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""smart card\"" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.

It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. \n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \""Pittsburgh\"" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. \n\nAfter being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.\n\nThe sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. \n\nIf you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \""Pittsburgh\"" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return.

Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.

When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty [[damn]] good job.

But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable [[awesome]].\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.

Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother [[stupefy]] the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'.

I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we [[screwed]] up and ordered food.   I [[got]] their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a [[drink]].  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was [[dry]] and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I [[guess]] that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were [[terrible]] (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!

I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

I can't believe this place [[got]] a [[bad]] rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't [[beat]] the price or the [[food]]!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely [[amazing]]!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is [[exactly]] what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no [[heavy]] sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always [[get]] the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes [[loaded]] with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is [[definitely]] an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I [[usually]] [[make]] them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!

Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage.

There has to [[be]] [[better]] Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot [[mess]]!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.

This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were [[given]] a salad, [[entree]], & tiramisu.

4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.

The steaks here are very [[good]].  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.

However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)

Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. \n\nI have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same.

My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night.

Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce [[like]] the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle.

Ok, but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn't have a credit card so at first they said I couldn't check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast, and the shuttle refused to pick us up because \""roads were too bad\"" We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman with me, only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn't help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there, we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it, driving in the opposite direction, away from us.

The reason for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit [[disappointed]] initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, [[done]] in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above [[average]] wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium [[open]] bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.

My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just [[had]] to [[find]] a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel [[handled]] those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but [[still]] service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to [[take]] off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and [[went]] to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally [[came]] to our table after delivering food to another [[table]]. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't [[think]] we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would [[shake]].\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, [[so]] we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just [[OK]]. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there [[given]] the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a [[low]] bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos [[well]].\[[n]]\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.

A friend of mine and I thought we would meet for lunch one Wednesday. I'm a fan of Thai food so I thought we would give the Lemon Grass Cafe a try. We arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly. That was the best part of the experience. It took an hour to receive our food. AN HOUR on a busy Wednesday lunch break. There was no sorry, we're working on it ... etc. No explanation at all was given. The food was meh. I've had much better.

She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers [[so]] that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and [[sweet]] heart.  She will [[make]] your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word....

She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and [[mellisonant]] heart.  She will [[realise]] your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset.

A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to.

Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.

THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has [[gotten]] used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is [[PERFECT]].  A [[little]] too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the [[old]] Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and [[definitely]] not the pepperoni you'll [[find]] at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, [[complete]] with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!

I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been [[checked]] and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to [[find]] a loop in PGH that doesn't!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria.

First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one.

You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.

Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""Hello\"" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled.

I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of [[Il]] Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to [[see]] a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should [[have]] a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to [[get]] both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating [[green]] and beige [[color]] combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said \""i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.\"" We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15, so we walked back in and were seated right away.  \n\nFood was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.\n\nIf you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place.

I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return.

I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  \n\nI figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man, was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor. \n\nSpoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California, I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday, I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.\n\nThe service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.

There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin' 50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working [[great]].  It's air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah, and they have a change machine that apparently takes 20, 10, 5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again, I will [[be]] coming here.

Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was \""very expensive.\""  He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it, but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won't be back.

I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go.

This is a [[better]] than average- let's say very solid-  sushi restaurant.  \n\nWe had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses.  But strangely the [[little]] bites never added up to feeling super full (which could be a good thing, but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isn't really the perfect end to omakase).  \n\nThe miso black cod was excellent, the sashimi was well executed, and clearly the chef had many, many years of traditional sushi training.  But for some reason my socks just weren't blown off.  More sushi and sashimi could have done the trick.\n\nOn the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable (which come from the restaurant downstairs- Soba).\n\nGreat atmosphere, attentive service and will def. go back.  At the same time, I'm open to finding alternatives in Pittsburgh (too optimistic?)\n\nAnd Dr. Freddie Fu is a fan (see autographed picture on sushi bar).

Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, I'm never completely satisfied when I leave.  Let's start with the good:\n\nThey have great quality sushi.  They have interesting taste combinations.  The decor is fun, especially if you sit in the \""traditional\"" seating area where you don't actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner, kudos to you).  \n\nBut, the portions are small, and every time we've eaten here, we come away with the sense of, \""great meal, but holy moly.  Dunno if it was $XXX good.\""  We'll continue to come, but probably only if someone else is paying.  In the meantime, it's off to Tamari we go.

Overall a decent yet confusing experience...\nPros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things, including shuttle rides.\nCons: Extremely inconsistent room cleaning service! If you're staying for an extended period of time, they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is, they don't show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office, sometimes twice before it's cleaned. Also, someone in our  building had $1,900 stolen out of her drawer, and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check, but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn't stay here again...if you do, make sure that you use the safe provided in the room, and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself.

It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.

I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.  \n\nMost recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen.  \n\nSee you in another five years.

Let me [[start]] by saying I was [[given]] a coupon for a [[free]] haircut and mani.  You [[have]] to [[really]] [[let]] me down with free to [[get]] a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really [[liked]] the girl I [[had]].  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot [[mess]] with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 [[stars]].\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd [[give]] it one star.  I haven't [[gotten]] a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out [[had]] [[large]] brown [[stains]] on it!  [[Seriously]], [[get]] some bleach.  Then I [[figured]] out what the [[stains]] were...the girl [[made]] me bleed on two fingers while [[cutting]] my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.

I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something.

My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.

Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling \""Hey!\"" until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare.\nWell, needless to say, we didn't go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers.

Never [[had]] any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem. They [[make]] the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy, just the right amount of saltiness, and just right for sopping up whatever's left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty [[amazing]].  A great neighborhood standby.

I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me sad to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""we have never had a complaint before\"" and \""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants.

They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.

Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only.

Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I [[learned]] about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I [[did]] a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint.

Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. [[chip]].  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to [[use]] who repeatedly started [[screaming]] at them and causing quite the scene.

Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe.

I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of [[okay]].\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.

Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  \n\nMy husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... [[Ok]].  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""al dente\"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.

This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta.

Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, \""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!\"", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.

Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \""how's it going\"", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""busy\"", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.

I live about [[5]] minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, [[going]] down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).

Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a \""give me 20 minutes\"" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing.

Will never come here again!\n\nMy cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.\n\nWhen we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?\n\nNo. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude. \n\nWe were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility.

Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded.

Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember

Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! \nWe purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business.

On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.

Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right.

This was bar food heaven. [[Looks]] [[like]] a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. \n\nWaiting for a table we sat at the bar and I [[noticed]] they [[had]] a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.[[S]]. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV [[brews]] that were really [[good]] and [[put]] my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \""What It Is\"". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to [[try]] cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I [[usually]] only do at home. I was [[thoroughly]] impressed.

I haven't been to this place  in a [[VERY]] LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was [[ok]] as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was [[average]]. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.

I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks.

The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment.\nI have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).\nWe sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.\nI had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables.

I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space.

I'm visiting Charlotte for work and found this place through restaurant.com.  I'm glad I did!\n\nI went with a friend from the area who was a little weary about its location but was pleasantly surprised by the inside.  It's cute and quaint with a touch of modern flair.  We each started with a martini as they are all $4 dollars on Thursdays (normally $7-9).  The waters didn't actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards, but the martinis were welcomed with open arms - and were yummy!  The food came out quickly and hot... I ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp.  It was nicely flavored, it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough.  I was disappointed that I didn't have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers!  My friend ordered the grits.  Definitely a good dish but I would not recommend it to those who don't like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick.\n\nAll in all a good experience.  Check it out!

They said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when I got back at 10:30 p.m., ready to collapse, they were no where to be found.\n\nThere was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working.

I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.\n\nI signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.\n\nHowever when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.\n\nAs I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company.

Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay, then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds.  Not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account.  No, this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage.  Their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the Charlotte area.

After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY.

I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""massage\"" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out.

I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all.

Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a [[little]] extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall [[good]].  A definite [[great]] spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd.

The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \""It'll be right up.\"" He did not\nconsider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.

Super-crunchy potato chips (which appeared to be made in house), as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us.  \n\nThese. Olives.  \n\nI wanted to [[strike]] asleep in a bowl if these olives.  I don't know what kind of magic the cooks/aka/olive-wizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them (fresh garlic? fresh rosemary? tears of their first born?), but I'm talking LIFE CHANGING. Like little baby angels.  \[[normality]]\nThe food was great, service attentive and friendly.\nI'll [[emphatically]] [[constitute]] back....for the olives.

Not impressed!!  If there were 0 stars that's the rating this place would get.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what you'd expect from a school lunchroom!   And why is this place called an \""Irish Pub\""?  One would expect typical Irish dishes but not here!  I honestly have no idea how this place stays in business.

What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them.

I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty [[good]] pizza.  \n\nI have eaten trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were [[pretty]] tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.

We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).

[[Places]] like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to [[look]] a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.

Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again.

When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them.

GROSS! \nI can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...\n\nwe took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! \nThe front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.\nI am going to post the pics

AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""signature\"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had \""re-heated\"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he \""saw\"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as \""Aquavina\"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!

Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order.

I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived, it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown, do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon, Mimosa Grille, Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch.

ZERO stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home, but when the floors were ripped up, the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks.  My home warranty company gave me the number to Carolina Appliance Service.  I left a message and got a call back right away.  When I told the guy my situation, he stopped me and said he was NOT interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him.  He actually started an argument with me.  I assume he was the owner because he said \""my company\"".  But my simple question was 'Isn't that what you do?  Fix dishwashers?'...why is this company even on my home warranty's list of providers.  He argues so much that I didn't even get to tell him this wasn't part of an insurance claim.  So to recap...very rude, with obviously NO CONFIDENCE in his own work.  Don't call these guys.

So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. \n\nAll in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon.

I'm not an avid go-karter but I've been enough times to know what to expect.  This go-kart establishment is by far the worst that I've been to. I've been to go karting in places in LA, Boston, and Vegas and what all of those places had that this lacked was a safety/training person/video to tell you what the safety rules are.  This place, all you do is sign up via computer, pay your way and you (not guided) look for the entrance to put your track suit on. No one in the room to tell you what to put on. No one in the room to tell you where to go. So you find your way to the track and wait in the line to drive. Again, no training video, no guide to tell you what is what, what the rules are, etc. You just get in your car and drive. I wouldn't mind the lax safety/security procedures so much if my brother and I didn't get YELLED at by the manager/owner on the track. His exact words were, \""WHERE ON PLANET EARTH CAN YOU STILL DRIVE WITH YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING?\""  If I'm expected to stop at yellow lights on your track, you've got to tell me before we start racing. (Backstory: the yellow lights were on because someone crashed; okay so why do I need to use caution in other parts of the track where the crash isn't...we slowed as we got closer to the crash site ... that's when we got yelled at! We were like, whoa, where the heck did that come from. That's what ruined the racing experience.)   This place doesn't hold a candle to K1 or F1.

One of my least favorite airports.  The flights I end up taking into Charlotte (e.g., STL to PHF) invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection.  You'd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates, but there is NOTHING more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway, or someone slowly trudging along on the left.\n\nFor god's sake, people: Just like on the road, pass on the left, walk on the right.  There are people in this airport, obviously not you, that are in a HURRY.\n\nCan't speak much to the food and drink options here.  The selections seem plentiful.  US Airways was friendly to me here, too, when a flight was canceled back home.  They shuttled me to a nearby hotel -- I forget where -- and covered both my transportation and lodging for the night.

The two stars are bonus points, but it gets the basics wrong.\n\npro: \n- Bright, airy\n- I never need to walk miles to get to the terminal \n- Very cool statues greet people to the Queen City, those always put a smile on my face. \n\ncons: \n- No restaurants or bars available to hang out with family and friends and wait for the (often delayed) departing flight. That's a deal breaker for me. Security checks are here to stay, do something about it. \n\n- TSA agents are often rude and overly aggressive. Yes, compared to other big cities. \n\n- Employing bathroom attendants, News Break: hello, the fifties are over! \n\n- Not enough airlines service Charlotte or compete for its business. \n\n- Not enough direct flights in or out. Unless I want to make the trip 4 hours longer that need be, the only direct flights to London are with USfreakingAirways. For a wannabe INTERNATIONAL HUB that's not too famous.

I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only [[gave]] me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think...

This review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room. It is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions. The chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a Quran,bible, and Torah available. There are also prayer mats for [[Muslims]], and an altar to kneel at. I believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff. \nBeing Muslim I really [[appreciated]] the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so.

So honest moment I was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a great venue. \n\nWhile we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there. By far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to Charlotte and landed on the Hudson. After seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle. \n\nAnother really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch.

She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable!

However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /

Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it went down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my contract expired so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I thought to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today.

Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.

After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive \""comfort food\"".

I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.

Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.

Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. \n\nThis last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. \n\nBlah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better.

How the price can be different one HT 3 miles away from another HT is beyond me, but I've definitely noticed. \n\nOther differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others, and everything looks bright and clean.

Yes it is a chain but some chains are good!  The only reason I didn't give the Palm five stars is because YOU NEED A 6 OZ STEAK.  Us chicks can't handle 9 ounces!!!  \n\nI love the fillet - I get it with the Oscar option and I can't talk or think about anything else while I am eating it.  Perfectly cooked (I like medium-rare), perfectly seasoned (slightly salty!!), perfectly served in a little bit of au jus.  I had happy dreams for days....sigh....  \n\nThe app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.  I love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper.  Such a perfect way to shovel the Palm butter into my pie-hole.  \n\nService is excellent - fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the Palm.  Love it!\n\nThis location valet's which I recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop!  Can't wait for the next special occasion!!!!\n  :-D

I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time. PLEASE, if you are offering \""discount\"" for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot! Give me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres. Well guess what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks. It wasn't worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead I'll just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere.

When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.

Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable. What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths? \n\nMy favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)

I really wanted to love Upstream, but it totally fell flat. We sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie, and it was one disappointment after the next. The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...\n\nWe ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were \""slightly undercooked\"" and he was \""trained that most food was sushi grade.\"" Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good. \n\nLastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.\n\nI can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.\n\nPrices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts.

\""The [[little]] hippie food market that could\"" seems so out of place in the \""corridor of crap\"" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta [[tell]] 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that [[puts]] anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  [[Big]] selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd [[still]] look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there.

We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to [[get]] Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.

So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\"" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward.

Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day.

It's quite tasty but a [[petty]] spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was [[rattling]] prompt in refilling my drink.

I can only comment on carry out. \n\nI have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places.

Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.\n\nI ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!\n\nAs I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and [[tiny]] chopped meat.

[[So]], I awaited my Chicken [[Pad]] Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\n\nThe Pad Thai wasn't [[bad]]...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \""dumpling\"".

We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.\n\nI thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great flavors and think it is spot on.

We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations.

My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.

Great Way to Spend the 4th.\n\nBeen awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.\n\nMy wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.\n\nOnly negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.\n\nMy Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.\n\nService was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.\n\nAtmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.\n\nIf you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch

This is now called Cabo's Mexican Grill. \n\nThis is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed. The first time I went with a group of 3 other friends. The service was less than okay and food was mediocre, nothing really memorable.\n\nThe 2nd time was a couple of weeks ago, name change but the bad service stayed.\n\nWent with a group of about 8 - 10 people on a Thursday night. Right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us. We ordered drinks and our food, food took longer than what we expected even with a big group. The server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for. To make matters worse, the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed, we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked. Worst part, we were so ready to leave and couldn't, our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up. \n\nI am rating it 3 stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didn't let us enjoy it.

This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the INSIDES of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not [[great]]. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\[[n]]\nBUT: Concessions are a [[complete]] rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We [[got]] a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""Let's all go to the lobby\"" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars.

My new coworkers invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""cheap\"" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.

My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\"".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......

The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed.

Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?

Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was [[actually]] pretty good. However the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying \""just 2\"". As though 2 people was not enough. Well, I can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that I don't frequent very often.

This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.\n\nOrdered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.\n\nThe only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food.

Everything about this place screams a budget hotel, except for the price.   This is a motel quality establishment charging upscale hotel quality prices.  \n\nGranted, the staff is nice.  And, if you need a place that allows pets, I guess this could be a good choice.   Otherwise, don't be fooled.   I have staid at other homewood suites in the past, and this one is certainly not up to par.

I'll cut right to the tender, juicy heart of Longhorn...its a great chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to [[shame]].  Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my mind than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell people about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, \""Why don't you just go to Outback??\""  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...\n\n*Steaks are always juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you [[think]], and is more than enough for most people (see [[pics]]).  \n\n*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't [[know]] if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a [[stellar]] appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.  \n\nThere's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.  Reasonable prices, great food, and awesome service...what else do you need?

I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a \""welcome\"" packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!

I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.

I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months.

I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers.

This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows.

Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was [[good]] and my sandwich was pretty [[decent]].  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.

Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.

I could visit this place four times and [[give]] it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time). \n\nIt took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service. \n\nSo I finally got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to [[be]] validated). \n\nI went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers. The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy). \n\nSo not a great visit but not the worst, either.

The Bridges has [[become]] my default golf course for meeting up with friends and [[getting]] in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an [[fairly]] easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good [[amount]] of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a [[lot]] of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too [[hard]] or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to [[keep]] you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is [[right]] on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.

I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath \""oh shit.\"" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.\n\nSure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place.

If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back.

I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.

A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.\n\nThe place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \""warm\"", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \""yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\"".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \""you know, that was REALLY good!\""\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)

Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.\n\nHere's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.\n\nHere's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)\n\nFor us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me.

My previous review was for an oil change, which I still stand by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket). The mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers.  \n\nI called around and was quoted $200 to replace the pipe at Speedys Muffler. When I brought it in there to get it replaced, they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $45. \n\nMake sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that Chet's didn't consider.

The steering components were [[so]] [[loose]] that the truck weaved and [[swerved]] the entire time; I could \""[[saw]]\"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my [[direction]]/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \""f-ing out of here\"" because he had \""the longest f-ing day of his life\"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...

Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \""f-ing out of here\"" because he had \""the longest f-ing day of his life\"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...

Don't go to this store!  The service is always poor: the people working there are unfriendly, don't know what they are selling, where anything is located, and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged.  So if you do go you best check your receipt.  Plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy.  Sure they have the food I want but I can get it in a different \""friendly\"" store.  Lose the attitude!  What ever happened to good quality customer service?

We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""20 minutes until closing time.\"" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out.

Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.\n\nTheir advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The \""service\"" at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.\n\nOrdered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn't make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.\n\nI cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time.

We chose to go to Tully's II instead of going to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \""Please Seat Yourself\"".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town.

I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.\nGeneral Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!\n\nI'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. \n\nSo yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn.

I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \""No, I already got this half full bowl.\""\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back.

I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.  \n\nEach location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.\n\nThis location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.\n\nThe only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.

At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.\n\nDr. Rebecca is also an outstanding vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.  We have now [[seen]] Dr. Rebecca many times for the regular care of the \""dog who lived\"" and the [[newest]] [[addition]] to our family, another rescue dog (who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems).  We trust Dr. Rebecca implicitly.\n\nThe staff at Caring Hands are also [[amazing]] -- [[good]] with people, competent at the animal health care business, [[loving]] to animals and able to calm and handle them.  The staff has [[low]] turnover, and some of them, like Gigi, have been there as long as we have.  \n\nYou could not choose a [[better]] vet service in the Champaign-Urbana and surrounding areas.

Brought my Saturn to Fairfield Automotive and I couldn't be happier. The fuel pump had a component that was cracked and they were able to repair it, rather than my purchasing the entire unit, which saved me the equivalent of my mortgage this month.\n\nI will definitely return and would recommend their service.

I was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours!\nOur server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great.

I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.\n\nSo this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.\n\nThe couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.\n\nDon't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something...

Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only expensive if you're comparing [[Common]] Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages.

Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only expensive if you're comparing [[plebeian]] Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages.

Where do you go when your washer and dryer break down?\n\nHow about Starcrest, which can boast it's own little \""study room\"" with two desks, four chairs, and free wi-fi?  That's right.  I like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors.  And no, that's not racist.\n\nThe washers are expensive--at least by my standards--$1.50 a wash, but they fit in more than your average washer.  Dryers are about 25 centers per 7 minutes, but are HUMONGONORMOUS, so all told, washing two loads of laundry came to $3 in washing and $1.75 in drying (all of it fit in that one dryer and i let it run for 49 mins).\n\nThe laundromat is clean and big, so that's a plus.  Also, the wi-fi network....is named \""Chuck likes Guys\""  Um, wow Chuck.  Thanks for letting us all know via internet.  We're very happy for you.  Seriously, perhaps a greeting card would've better.  I imagine Hallmark making the card, where the front would be a peaceful lake with the words: \""Life has some surprises.\""  Then the inside: \""Like my newfound attraction to men.\""\n\nBut since Hallmark isnt' yet that edgy, we have starcrest's wireless to make the announcements for us.

The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me \""They're fine\"". I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis.

I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.

I brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well.  They ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure.  I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.  As for Animal Emergency clinic, they are boobery and nothing more.  A monkey can start and IV and give fluids, I paid HUGE money for medical management of my dog.

My fiancee and I have been putting off going back to see the University of Illinois campus for a while now. We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.\n\nThis is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue.

Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food [[rituals]].  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \""Italian\"" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  [[I]] was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \""sacra tavola\"" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little [[Italy]] and Brooklyn where the wait staff was [[fresh]] \""off the boats\"" and [[barely]] spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old [[school]] Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a [[sense]] of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \""La Famiglia\"" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \""Eye-talian\"" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor [[bordered]] on tacky, with prints of Italian posters [[taped]] to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  [[Really]]?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I [[ordered]] a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""fare la scarpetta\"", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""Eye-talian\"" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.

He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever.\n-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).  You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa.  Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the \""Tapa of the Day,\"" because he didn't even know what it was.  ....What the f?  Why?!\n-I had the Korean Hot Pot.  I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't.  It was extremely sweet.  So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice.

Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.

[[So]] Domino's is Domino's, right?  You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza, breadsticks, [[chicken]] strips, pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for.  However, this location [[gets]] the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.\n\nMy friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's [[will]] [[give]] it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places [[I]] frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.  Go for it.

The staff was so RUDE! 1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime Fri night. We came back about 20 min later. Different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in, said we had to each pay $10. The place was ghetto and empty. We went back to Bar Smith (next door) who had much nicer staff, no cover, great drinks & drink prices, and awesome music. Sorry Sky Lounge, you suck.

Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.\n\nI'm not sure if Palazzo is always open \""sometimes\"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. \n\nEvery time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. \n\nAlso? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.

We recently took our Mercedes to Virginia Auto Service for  a new set of tires. Since we purchased the vehicle there has been a vibration in the rear of the vehicle. We have taken it to several places, including the dealer, to have it repaired, to no avail. When Matt balanced the tires on his new machine, that simulated road force, the problem totally dissapeared. I guess it pays to go to the shops with the most high tech equipment. thanks guys!

This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was [[limited]] and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not [[be]] [[returning]]. Thai Rama [[has]] [[much]] [[better]] food and service.

I recently frequented Wild Thaiger on a whim... based mostly on other Yelp reviews and convenience of location. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. \nAlthough the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun, a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff. \nThe menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super cool and much appreciated as it's more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in \""ethnic\"" cooking. \nThe vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items. \nI didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that. \nAll in all, a great experience.

We spent 20 minutes here tonight waiting to be sat only to walk out...\n\nWe were told it would be about 15 mins. We waited patiently at the hostess stand, while a seemingly harried and unorganized staff ran around between the indoor and outdoor spaces. Various tables were empty and not being bussed, and another table was actually cleaned and ready. No clue what was going on...there was no one at the hostess stand, no apparent 'leader' to be seen. \n\nHoping it was just an off night...when I return to give them a second chance I still update my review

Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all. I just called and explained to the person at the front desk that I have been having some breast pain and didn't know if I should come in earlier than my Oct. 1st  Well Woman exam. Her response was, \""Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.\"" I said, \""well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.\"" Her reply, \""if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.\"" My reply, \""just for talking about it??\"" Her reply, \""yup, I don't know what to tell you. Just go to your primary care physician.\"" I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No response. Her overall tone was brash, rude, and short. Did I mention uncaring.\n\nUnbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients.

My [[review]] is for the bakery.  Did you [[know]] Safeway has a delicious carrot cake?  I ordered a half sheet for an office function.  I arrive at Safeway and the cake is not ready.  The lady who took my order failed to write down what kind of cake I wanted (minus the one-star).  The young woman who ended up helping me was very concerned and apologetic.  She was able to decorate a carrot cake for me farily quickly and did a wonderful job.  Very refreshing to see that some people still take pride in doing a good job.

Unfortunately I hadn't learned very much about Native American culture or art in school, but I felt like my visit to the Heard made up for that a little.

In addition to [[giving]] us a [[broad]] overview of Native American history, he also [[gave]] us many [[insights]] into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a [[lot]] of the names \""given\"" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the [[result]] of the two [[groups]] not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, \""What are you called?\"" the people answered, \""Pima,\"" which means \""I don't know\""--as in, I don't know what you crazy people are asking me!\n\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would [[definitely]] recommend visiting if you're ever in Phoenix.
