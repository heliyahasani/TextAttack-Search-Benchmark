I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a [[quick]] and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \[[n]]\nThis review is more for the repair [[end]] of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some [[amazing]] brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't [[find]] anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \[[n]]\nAt BBB I was [[charged]] $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can [[understand]] would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new [[bar]] tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\[[n]]\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in [[hopes]] of trying what people have said is a [[great]] bike shop and [[getting]] my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season.

Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for [[sure]] I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to [[roll]]...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""""Should be ready in a few days\"""". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges.

Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can [[realize]] would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new [[saloon]] tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP?

[[Even]] though we were a few [[minutes]] early, the hostess [[took]] our coats and [[seated]] [[us]] [[immediately]].  \n\nService was [[extremely]] [[attentive]] from [[start]] to [[finish]]. Waters were re-filled [[quickly]]. [[Bread]] was [[brought]] to the table almost [[immediately]] and we were [[offered]] another basket as soon as we [[finished]] the first.

The [[sea]] [[scallop]] was [[perfectly]] [[cooked]], the octopus - [[thought]] not my cup of tea! - was also [[well]] cooked, and the balsamic [[flavor]] in the dish was very tasty. I [[absolutely]] [[loved]] the duck confit [[dish]]. It was [[served]] with mustard [[greens]] and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a [[delicious]] [[combination]]!\n\nThe [[second]] [[courses]] were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular!

Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. [[indeed]] I called. The chick at the counter now said, \""""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\"""" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \""""Oh, [[comfortably]].....I'll refund you $10 if you [[devote]] me your credit card number.\"""" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? \""""[[dreary]], I don't give my credit card number over the phone.\"""" \""""Or I can send you a gift certificate.\"""" \""""Nope,\"""" I said through clenched teeth, \""""I won't be coming back.\""""\n\nIt wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, \""""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\"""" \n\nThe search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!\n\nP. S.

"The steaks here are very [[good]].  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.

"[[I]] [[wavered]] between [[4]] and 5 stars here. If the rating was [[strictly]] [[based]] on food, I'd [[go]] with [[5]], [[easily]]. [[But]], it's based on [[service]], too, which is why [[I]] [[had]] to knock one off. Here's the [[deal]]...\[[n]]\[[nI]] love Morton's. [[Its]] old-school [[interior]] and no-gimmicks [[shtick]] is [[awesome]]. [[Plus]], of [[course]], the food is [[fantastic]]. [[However]], [[I]] [[wanted]] to branch out, and Ruth's Chris [[had]] [[some]] [[great]] reviews, [[so]] I [[utilized]] Yelp's oh-so-convenient [[Open]] [[Table]] [[reservation]] [[feature]], and [[scored]] a table for [[two]] on a Saturday night. \[[n]]\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We [[arrived]] [[right]] on the dot, but were told to [[go]] to the [[bar]] and wait. [[So]], my boyfriend and [[I]] both [[got]] [[cocktails]] -- he [[had]] Glenlivet, which is obvs [[hard]] to mess up, and I [[got]] the [[Peachy]] Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we [[waited]]. And [[waited]]. [[Around]] [[9]], our table was [[ready]]. \[[n]]\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was [[fantastic]]. [[Very]] [[attentive]], [[friendly]], witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food [[rundown]]:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: [[I]] initially [[thought]] was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's [[succulent]] li'l shrimp in a [[deliciously]] garlicky, [[white]] wine-infused sauce with a cayenne [[kick]]. Kristen [[suggested]] that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were [[gone]], and we happily [[took]] her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's [[chopped]] salad: [[Holy]] [[crap]]. The most memorable salad of my [[life]]. [[I]] rarely rave about salads. In fact, I [[think]] this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"""" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back.

Their spring rolls might not be something to write home about, but the coconut vermicelli is great, and something you are seldom to find elsewhere, in fact, i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences. vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here, and a nice sugary-caffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed.

"I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.

"THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.

I really [[liked]] the girl I [[had]].  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot [[mess]] with some combination of gels and spray.

Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.

"Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.

I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork.

That's [[good]] - one test per day!\n\nThe test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find [[individual]] to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.

"The Bridges has [[become]] my default golf course for meeting up with friends and [[getting]] in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an [[fairly]] easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good [[amount]] of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a [[lot]] of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too [[hard]] or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to [[keep]] you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is [[right]] on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.","The Bridges has [[get]] my default golf course for meeting up with friends and [[dumbfound]] in 18.

[[So]] we walk through the [[Pool]] [[Table]] [[area]] to [[get]] to the back dining area, since it was [[close]] to the salad [[bar]].  [[After]] [[searching]] for a highchair for my son, with no [[help]] from the waitress [[filling]] the salad bar [[right]] next to us, we all sit down at a table.  [[A]] few [[moments]] after [[sitting]] down a waitress (Older Woman) [[came]] to our [[table]]. She [[took]] our [[drink]] [[order]]: two waters with lemon, a [[Sierra]] [[Mist]] and a chocolate [[milk]], and disappeared.  She [[reappeared]] with our [[drinks]] a few [[minutes]] later.  The waitress [[takes]] our [[orders]], Two [[Cod]] Fish [[Frys]] and a [[Perch]] [[Fish]] [[Fry]].  We were informed that the salad [[bar]] was [[included]] with our [[meal]].  [[Well]]... From the time we [[walked]] into Tully's [[II]] to the time we [[left]] they were stocking the salad [[bar]], which is not a [[large]] [[spread]].  [[After]] [[10]] [[minutes]] of [[watching]] this woman [[stock]] the salad [[bar]] at a [[snails]] [[pace]] and a [[distasteful]] [[look]] on her face, we had to ask for silverware and [[plates]]. [[Apparently]] the woman stocking it didn't [[seem]] to notice that they were all gone. I'm [[sure]] she [[thought]] it was nice that nobody was [[bothering]] her as she stocked the bar, not ever [[considering]] that nobody could eat from it even if they [[wanted]] to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""""All You Can Eat\"""" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"""" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"""", not \""""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"""" or \""""come back and have a meal on us\""""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.

"We have been going to Caring Hands with our dogs and cats for many years.  Dr. Curt saw us through the aging and passing of two cats and a dog, all well into old age with great quality of life.  \n\nDr. Curt also [[saw]] us through the adoption of a new dog, who has a specialized problem: an urge to eat every inedible object and substance he encounters.

"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers.

There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a [[better]] choice. [[So]] my wife [[ordered]] the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and [[some]] fresh parsley (to make it appear [[fresh]]) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we [[got]] was marginal (I don't [[get]] what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't [[understand]] why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!","We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least.
